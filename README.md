# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project specification outlines the design and development of a face recognition attendance system using Python 3.12 with libraries OpenCV, Face_Recognition and Tkinter. 

The system aims to automate attendance tracking through real-time face detection, recognition of pre-enrolled faces, and logging attendance records. Key functionalities include robust face detection algorithms and machine learning models for accurate recognition, integrated with a user-friendly interface for system management and reporting. 

The project encompasses detailed requirements, technical specifications, and an implementation plan structured around milestones and timelines. Testing and validation procedures ensure compliance with performance metrics and user acceptance criteria. Security measures address data encryption and privacy concerns following regulatory standards.


## Features

1. **Maintains Student Records**: Stores student details and images.
2. **Take Attendance using Face Recognition**: Uses face recognition for taking attendance.
3. **User Friendly UI**: Ease to use and straight forward UI.
